Minimalist framework instead of Angular,React,Vue,Solid,Svelte,Lit

- type **npm install -g wok.js** to install the package globally

- type    **wokproj**                  into your terminal to create a wok.js project (Win11: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted)

- type    **wok somename**      to create a new wok

- type    **fry**              to start your wok.js application


# TODO
✔ rebuild the component on save, so we don't have to 'npm run fry' every time, we make a change 

✔ rebuild when save happens in regural html files too (not only in woks) 

✔ find a way to shorten the command which creates a new wok, beacuse 'npm run wok wokname' is too long 

? find a way to achieve highlighting in the css part of the wok, and override linting errors

? find a way to run the app from memory, and only build it when we want to deploy it
